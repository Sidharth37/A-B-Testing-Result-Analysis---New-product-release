# A-B-Testing-Result-Analysis---New-product-release

A/B testing is the process of comparing 2 versions of the same asset, and evaluating the difference in performance. It is used everywhere from thumbnails in Netflix, to new product releases on Amazon, to display of search results on Google. But once the results are obtained it becomes equally important to understand if the difference in results are statistically significant or was it a random occurences that took place because of particular samples being selected by chance. In this project we will compare 3 such promotions carried across different of varying sizes across locations and understand if 1 promotional campaign is better than the other, and help the firm decide on a marketing strategy for it's newly released product.<br><br>
